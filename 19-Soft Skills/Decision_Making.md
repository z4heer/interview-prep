## üõ†Ô∏è Key Technical Words
| Term | Definition |
|:---|:---|
| Tech Stack | A set of technologies used to build and run an application. |
| Architecture Patterns | Proven solutions to recurring problems in software architecture (e.g., microservices, monolithic). |
| Trade-offs | Balancing between different aspects like performance, cost, scalability, and maintainability. |
| Cost of Ownership | The total cost of maintaining and scaling a technology stack over time. |
