# API Gateway Design

Designing an API Gateway for routing requests, load balancing, and managing microservices in a scalable architecture.

---

## üß† Mind Map

- **Core Components**
  - Request Routing
  - Authentication & Authorization
  - Rate Limiting & Throttling
  - Load Balancing
  - API Versioning
  - Logging & Monitoring
  - Caching for Response Optimization

- **Scalability & Performance**
  - Horizontal Scaling of API Gateway
  - Service Discovery Integration
  - Circuit Breaker Pattern
  - Asynchronous Processing of Requests

- **Security**
  - OAuth 2.0 Authentication
  - JWT Token Validation
  - SSL/TLS Encryption
  - DDoS Protection and Traffic Filtering

## üéØ Key Technical Words & Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|:-----|:-----------|
| API Gateway | A server that acts as an API front-end to aggregate, route, and manage requests to microservices. |
| Load Balancing | Distributing traffic across multiple service instances to improve performance and availability. |
| Rate Limiting | Limiting the number of API requests a client can make within a given period. |
| Circuit Breaker | A pattern that detects and handles failures in a service, preventing a failure cascade. |
| Service Discovery | A mechanism for locating and managing microservices within an architecture. |

## ‚ùì Common Interview Questions

- How would you handle authentication and authorization in an API Gateway?
- What is the role of an API Gateway in a microservices architecture?
- How do you implement rate limiting in an API Gateway?
- How would you scale an API Gateway to handle millions of requests?
- How do you ensure high availability and fault tolerance in an API Gateway?

## üõ†Ô∏è Code Snippet Example - Basic API Gateway (Spring Boot)

```java
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableEurekaClient
@EnableZuulProxy
public class ApiGatewayApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(ApiGatewayApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```
*Spring Boot application for an API Gateway using Zuul Proxy.*

## ‚úÖ Best Practices Summary

- Use an API Gateway to handle request routing, load balancing, and authentication for microservices.
- Implement rate limiting to avoid service overloads and ensure fair usage.
- Integrate API versioning to ensure backward compatibility.
- Use a circuit breaker pattern to handle failures gracefully.
- Implement logging and monitoring to track API usage and performance.

---

## üö´ Common Mistakes

- Overloading the API Gateway with too many responsibilities, making it a bottleneck.
- Not implementing proper API versioning, leading to breaking changes.
- Ignoring security best practices like JWT validation and SSL encryption.
- Failing to use caching mechanisms to reduce unnecessary load on backend services.
- Not considering scalability in the initial API Gateway design.

## üìã Cheat Sheet Summary

| Area | Key Tip |
|:-----|:--------|
| Authentication | Use OAuth2 and JWT for secure and stateless authentication |
| Load Balancing | Use round-robin or weighted load balancing for service distribution |
| Rate Limiting | Implement rate limits to protect APIs from abuse |
| Fault Tolerance | Apply circuit breakers to handle service failures gracefully |
| Security | Use SSL/TLS for encryption and validate tokens for authentication |
