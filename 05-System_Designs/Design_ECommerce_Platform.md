# Design E-Commerce Platform

System design for a scalable and efficient E-Commerce platform.

---

## üß† Mind Map

- **Core Components**
  - User Management (Authentication, Authorization)
  - Product Catalog
  - Shopping Cart
  - Payment Gateway Integration
  - Order Management System
  - Inventory Management
  - Search & Recommendation System

- **Scalability & Performance**
  - Load Balancing
  - Caching Strategy (e.g., Redis)
  - Horizontal Scaling
  - Microservices Architecture

- **Database Design**
  - Relational Databases (e.g., PostgreSQL for transactions)
  - NoSQL Databases (e.g., MongoDB for product catalog)

- **Security**
  - HTTPS, OAuth2, JWT for secure communication
  - Data Encryption
  - Secure Payment Handling

## üéØ Key Technical Words & Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|:-----|:-----------|
| Microservices | Decompose the platform into independent, loosely-coupled services. |
| Load Balancer | Distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure high availability. |
| Redis | In-memory data store, used for caching frequently accessed data. |
| JWT | JSON Web Token for secure user authentication. |
| Payment Gateway | Integration with third-party services (e.g., Stripe) for handling transactions. |

## ‚ùì Common Interview Questions

- How would you design the product catalog for scalability?
- Explain how you would handle high traffic during sales events.
- How do you ensure the security of payment transactions?
- What would you consider when designing a user authentication system?
- How would you implement recommendation systems in an E-Commerce platform?

## üõ†Ô∏è Code Snippet Example - Product Search Query (SQL)

```sql
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE product_name LIKE '%smartphone%' 
  AND category_id = 5 
ORDER BY price DESC;
```
*Searches for products by name and category, ordered by price.*

## ‚úÖ Best Practices Summary

- Use microservices to break down functionalities like payment, catalog, and inventory.
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data like product details and user sessions.
- Use a combination of relational and NoSQL databases for scalability.
- Handle transactions using distributed transactions or event-driven architecture.
- Ensure security with HTTPS, secure payment systems, and encryption.
- Leverage horizontal scaling and auto-scaling groups for handling high traffic.

---

## üö´ Common Mistakes

- Using a monolithic approach when scalability is a concern.
- Not optimizing product search performance.
- Ignoring the importance of high availability during traffic spikes.
- Not encrypting sensitive data like payment information.
- Relying solely on a single database for all types of data.

## üìã Cheat Sheet Summary

| Area | Key Tip |
|:-----|:--------|
| Scalability | Microservices, caching, load balancing |
| Security | HTTPS, OAuth2, JWT, encryption |
| Payment | Use third-party services for payment processing |
| Database | Hybrid use of SQL and NoSQL for scalability |
| Performance | Optimize for search and caching |
