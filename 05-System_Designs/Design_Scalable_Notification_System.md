# Design Scalable Notification System

Designing a system capable of sending notifications at scale, efficiently and reliably.

---

## üß† Mind Map

- **Core Components**
  - Notification Types (Email, SMS, Push Notifications)
  - User Preferences and Opt-In Management
  - Message Queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ)
  - Notification Dispatcher
  - Delivery Tracking
  - Retry Mechanism for Failures
  - Analytics and Metrics

- **Scalability & Performance**
  - Horizontal Scaling for Notification Services
  - Load Balancing
  - Caching to Handle High Load
  - Asynchronous Processing (via Message Queues)

- **Security & Compliance**
  - GDPR Compliance for User Data
  - Rate Limiting for Notification Frequency
  - Secure API for Sending Notifications

## üéØ Key Technical Words & Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|:-----|:-----------|
| Notification Queue | A queue for storing and processing notification tasks asynchronously (e.g., Kafka). |
| Opt-In Management | Handling user preferences to decide whether they wish to receive notifications. |
| Push Notifications | Notifications delivered to a user's device even when the app is not actively in use. |
| Retry Mechanism | A system to handle failed notification deliveries by retrying them at intervals. |
| Delivery Tracking | Monitoring whether the notification has been successfully delivered to the user. |

## ‚ùì Common Interview Questions

- How would you design a notification system to handle millions of users?
- How do you handle retry mechanisms for failed notifications?
- How do you ensure delivery guarantees for critical notifications (e.g., payment success)?
- How would you implement an opt-in system for notifications?
- What measures would you take to prevent abuse of the notification system (e.g., spam)?

## üõ†Ô∏è Code Snippet Example - Email Notification Dispatcher (Java)

```java
@Service
public class EmailNotificationService {

    private final JavaMailSender mailSender;

    @Autowired
    public EmailNotificationService(JavaMailSender mailSender) {
        this.mailSender = mailSender;
    }

    public void sendEmail(String to, String subject, String body) {
        SimpleMailMessage message = new SimpleMailMessage();
        message.setTo(to);
        message.setSubject(subject);
        message.setText(body);
        mailSender.send(message);
    }
}
```
*Sends an email notification using Spring's `JavaMailSender`.*

## ‚úÖ Best Practices Summary

- Implement a queue-based system (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) for handling large volumes of notifications.
- Use asynchronous processing to ensure non-blocking delivery of notifications.
- Implement retry mechanisms for failed deliveries to guarantee eventual success.
- Secure the system with appropriate authentication and rate-limiting to avoid abuse.
- Ensure user preferences are respected by storing notification opt-in settings securely.
- Monitor notification delivery and failure rates to improve system reliability.

---

## üö´ Common Mistakes

- Not implementing an efficient retry mechanism for failed notifications.
- Ignoring the delivery guarantees for critical notifications (e.g., payment confirmations).
- Not handling user opt-out preferences properly, violating privacy regulations.
- Using a monolithic approach that doesn't scale efficiently under load.

## üìã Cheat Sheet Summary

| Area | Key Tip |
|:-----|:--------|
| Notification Delivery | Use message queues for asynchronous processing |
| Retry Mechanism | Implement exponential backoff strategies for retries |
| Opt-In System | Respect user preferences and comply with GDPR regulations |
| Scaling | Horizontal scaling and load balancing for the notification services |
| Security | Secure APIs and use rate-limiting to prevent abuse |
