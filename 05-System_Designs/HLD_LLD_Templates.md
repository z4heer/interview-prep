# HLD & LLD Templates

Templates for High-Level Design (HLD) and Low-Level Design (LLD) to guide system architecture documentation.

---

## üß† Mind Map

- **High-Level Design (HLD)**
  - Overview of System Architecture
  - Key Components (e.g., Services, Databases, APIs)
  - Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)
  - Interaction Between Components
  - Major Technologies Used (e.g., Cloud, Databases, Messaging)

- **Low-Level Design (LLD)**
  - Detailed Component Design
  - API Design and Endpoints
  - Data Models and Database Schemas
  - Object-Oriented Design (Classes, Methods)
  - Sequence Diagrams
  - Error Handling Mechanisms

## üéØ Key Technical Words & Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|:-----|:-----------|
| High-Level Design (HLD) | Overview of the system architecture, focusing on key components and their interactions. |
| Low-Level Design (LLD) | Detailed design specifying the internal workings of components, including database schemas, APIs, and classes. |
| Data Flow Diagram (DFD) | A diagram that represents the flow of data through a system. |
| Sequence Diagram | A diagram that shows the interactions between components over time. |
| Class Diagram | A diagram that represents the structure of a system in terms of classes, their attributes, and relationships. |

## ‚ùì Common Interview Questions

- What is the difference between HLD and LLD?
- How do you decide what goes into HLD and what goes into LLD?
- Can you explain how you would document the interaction between microservices in an HLD?
- How would you represent database interactions in an LLD?
- What tools would you use to create HLD and LLD documents?

## üõ†Ô∏è Code Snippet Example - API Endpoint Design (RESTful API)

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/products")
public class ProductController {

    @Autowired
    private ProductService productService;

    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public ResponseEntity<Product> getProductById(@PathVariable Long id) {
        Product product = productService.getProductById(id);
        return ResponseEntity.ok(product);
    }

    @PostMapping("/")
    public ResponseEntity<Product> createProduct(@RequestBody Product product) {
        Product createdProduct = productService.createProduct(product);
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.CREATED).body(createdProduct);
    }
}
```

## ‚úÖ Best Practices Summary

- Use HLD to give an overview of the system architecture and its components.
- Use LLD for detailed design specifications, including class diagrams and database schemas.
- Include error handling strategies and edge cases in LLD.
- Document interactions between components using sequence diagrams.
- Ensure API design is clear, with consistent endpoints, HTTP methods, and status codes.

---

## üö´ Common Mistakes

- Skipping detailed LLD documentation, which can lead to implementation inconsistencies.
- Including too much detail in HLD, making it difficult to understand the overall system.
- Not defining clear error handling strategies in LLD, leading to incomplete implementations.
- Ignoring API versioning and documentation in LLD.

## üìã Cheat Sheet Summary

| Area | Key Tip |
|:-----|:--------|
| HLD | Focus on overall system architecture and major components |
| LLD | Include detailed diagrams such as class and sequence diagrams |
| Error Handling | Always plan for exception handling and edge cases in LLD |
| API Design | Follow REST principles for designing clean and understandable APIs |
| Tools | Use tools like Lucidchart or draw.io for diagram creation |
