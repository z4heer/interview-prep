# 🧠 Cloud Platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) - Mind Map

---

## ☁️ Core Services (Common Across)
- **Compute** ➔ AWS EC2, GCP Compute Engine, Azure VMs
- **Serverless** ➔ AWS Lambda, GCP Cloud Functions, Azure Functions
- **Storage** ➔ AWS S3, GCP Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage
- **Database** ➔ AWS RDS, GCP Cloud SQL, Azure SQL Database

---

## 🔹 Key Technical Words
- **Elasticity**: Scale resources up/down automatically.
- **High Availability**: Ensure minimal downtime.
- **Auto-scaling**: Dynamically adjust instances.
- **Multi-region Deployment**: Deploy services across geographies.
