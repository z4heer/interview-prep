# 🧠 Microservices & API Gateway - Mind Map

---

## 🏛️ Core Concepts
- Microservices ➔ Small, autonomous services.
- API Gateway ➔ Single-entry point for client requests.

---

## 🔹 Key Technical Words & Definitions
- **Service Discovery**: Auto-detect service instances.
- **Load Balancer**: Distributes incoming requests.
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevents cascading failures.
- **Service Mesh**: Manages service-to-service communication (e.g., Istio).

---

## 🎯 Best Practices
- 📦 Design services around business capabilities.
- 🔐 Secure APIs at Gateway level.
- 🛠️ Automate deployments.
- 📈 Centralized Monitoring and Logging.

---

## 🛠️ Common Tools
| Purpose | Tool |
|:---|:---|
| API Gateway | Kong, Apigee, AWS API Gateway |
| Service Discovery | Consul, Eureka |
| Service Mesh | Istio, Linkerd |

---

## ❓ Common Interview Questions
- How do you handle communication between microservices?
- Why is API Gateway important?
- Explain circuit breaker pattern.

---

## 📋 Cheat Sheet
| Microservice | API Gateway |
|:---|:---|
| Decentralized | Centralized |
| Own Database | Unified Endpoint |
| Stateless | Authentication, Routing, Caching |

---

## ⚡ Common Mistakes
- Monolith inside Microservices (tight coupling).
- Poor Gateway error handling.
- No versioning strategy for APIs.
