### **Project Implementation Guidance**
For each domain/project, the following general steps can be used to proceed with the implementation:

1. **Requirement Analysis & Functional Design**: Gather requirements and break them into functional components.
2. **Architecture Design**: 
   - Identify the right architecture (Microservices, Monolithic, Serverless, etc.).
   - Design key components, data flows, and APIs.
3. **Tech Stack Selection**: 
   - Choose the right technologies based on the system requirements (e.g., Spring Boot for backend, Angular/React for frontend, PostgreSQL for database, etc.).
4. **Implementation**: 
   - Develop backend and frontend services based on the defined architecture.
   - Ensure API security, scalability, and performance.
5. **Testing & Quality Assurance**: 
   - Conduct unit testing, integration testing, and load testing.
6. **Deployment & Monitoring**: 
   - Deploy the application using **Docker** or **Kubernetes**.
   - Set up **CI/CD pipelines** for continuous deployment.
7. **Documentation**: 
   - Document architecture, APIs, database schemas, and workflows.
