Would you like me to now also create:  
➡️ Folder structure + minimal **starter README** for each project as next step? (It will save you 50% time later.) 🚀  

**Which project should we start setting up first?**  
(Example: *Warehouse Management* or *Service Booking Platform*?)  
🎯  Let’s move fast!
