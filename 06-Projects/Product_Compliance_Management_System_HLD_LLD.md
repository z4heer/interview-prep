# 📦 Product Compliance Management System — HLD & LLD

---

## 📜 1. Problem Statement
Build a system to track, manage, and ensure all products comply with regional regulatory standards, certifications (RoHS, REACH, FDA, etc.), and company-specific policies before shipping or market release.

## 🏗 2. High-Level Architecture (HLD)

**Main Components:**
- Product Data Integration Service
- Compliance Rules Engine
- Certification Management Service
- Supplier Declaration Management
- Audit Trail and Reporting
- Notification Engine
- User/Admin Portal (Web App)

## 🛤️ 6. Low-Level Design (LLD)

### 📦 Database Schema (Simplified)

**Tables**
- `products` — product_id (PK), name, category, created_by, created_at
- `compliance_rules` — rule_id (PK), region, description, active_status
- `certifications` — cert_id (PK), product_id (FK), cert_type, expiry_date
- `supplier_declarations` — decl_id (PK), product_id (FK), supplier_id, material_info
- `audit_logs` — audit_id (PK), action, timestamp, user_id

### 🔄 APIs (Compliance Microservice)

| API Endpoint                          | Method | Description                          |
|----------------------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------|
| `/api/v1/products`                    | GET    | List all products                    |
| `/api/v1/compliance/validate/{product}`| POST   | Validate product compliance          |
| `/api/v1/certifications`              | POST   | Upload certifications                |
| `/api/v1/alerts`                      | GET    | List active compliance alerts        |

## 🔥 7. Scalability and Reliability Considerations

- **Event-driven design:** For compliance checks post product updates.
- **Document storage:** Store heavy files (certificates, declarations) externally.
- **Retry queues:** Retry failed validations or uploads gracefully.
- **Role-based security:** Fine-grained access control to prevent unauthorized changes.
- **Data archival:** Archive expired certificates for audit purposes.

---

## 🧩 8. Best Practices Summary

- Validate supplier data using schema validations.
- Compliance rules engine should be dynamically configurable.
- Separate user roles and permissions clearly (Supplier vs Internal).
- Build extensible audit logging for all user actions.

---

## 📋 9. Possible Interview/Discussion Questions

- How would you ensure real-time compliance validation at scale?
- How can the system handle different regional compliance standards?
- How to optimize storage and retrieval of certificates at scale?
- How would you implement workflow approval for supplier declarations?
