## üõ§Ô∏è 6. Low-Level Design (LLD)

### üì¶ Database Schema (Simplified)

**Tables/Collections**
- `production_orders` ‚Äî order_id (PK), status, product_id, quantity, assigned_machine
- `machines` ‚Äî machine_id (PK), type, current_status, last_maintenance
- `machine_events` ‚Äî event_id (PK), machine_id (FK), event_type, timestamp
- `inventory` ‚Äî item_id (PK), item_type (raw/finished), quantity, location
- `maintenance_tasks` ‚Äî task_id (PK), machine_id (FK), scheduled_date, status
- `kpi_metrics` ‚Äî record_id (PK), machine_id (FK), OEE, downtime_minutes, production_yield

## üî• 7. Scalability and Reliability Considerations

- **IoT Integration**: Lightweight MQTT for sensor communications; batch IoT data ingestion.
- **Real-Time KPIs**: Stream processing for real-time KPI updates.
- **Event Sourcing**: Critical for capturing machine state changes.
- **Database Partitioning**: Large-scale time-series data partitioned by machine and time.
- **Backup and Restore**: For production orders and maintenance schedules.

## üß© 8. Best Practices Summary

- Ensure message durability using Kafka or MQTT QoS settings.
- Keep IoT and core system loosely coupled for scalability.
- Implement data validation and noise filtering on incoming sensor data.
- Use caching for frequently accessed inventory data.
