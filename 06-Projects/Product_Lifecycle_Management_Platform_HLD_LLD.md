---

## üìú 1. Problem Statement
Develop a robust PLM platform to manage the lifecycle of a product from concept through design, manufacturing, service, and disposal. Enable cross-functional collaboration, version control, document management, and workflow approvals.

## üèó 2. High-Level Architecture (HLD)

**Main Components:**
- Product Master Data Management
- Document Management Service
- Change Management & Version Control
- Workflow Management (Approvals, Reviews)
- BOM (Bill of Materials) Management
- Analytics & Reporting Engine
- User/Admin Portal (Web App)

## üõ§Ô∏è 6. Low-Level Design (LLD)

### üì¶ Database Schema (Simplified)

**Tables/Collections**
- `products` ‚Äî product_id (PK), name, type, owner, status
- `documents` ‚Äî doc_id (PK), product_id (FK), file_url, version, created_by
- `change_requests` ‚Äî cr_id (PK), product_id (FK), description, status
- `boms` ‚Äî bom_id (PK), product_id (FK), parts_list (JSON), created_by
- `workflows` ‚Äî workflow_id (PK), entity_type, status, assigned_to

### üîÑ APIs (PLM Core Service)

| API Endpoint                              | Method | Description                       |
|--------------------------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------|
| `/api/v1/products`                        | GET    | List all products                 |
| `/api/v1/products`                        | POST   | Create a new product              |
| `/api/v1/documents/upload`                | POST   | Upload a new document             |
| `/api/v1/change-requests`                 | POST   | Submit a new change request       |
| `/api/v1/boms`                            | POST   | Create a new Bill of Materials    |

## üî• 7. Scalability and Reliability Considerations

- **Event-driven:** Product updates trigger revalidation workflows automatically.
- **Version control:** Strict document versioning policies (immutable past versions).
- **Authorization layers:** Fine-grained control at document and project level.
- **Distributed storage:** Use scalable cloud storage for document files.
- **Audit logs:** Track every change to product metadata and documents.

---

## üß© 8. Best Practices Summary

- Ensure document immutability once published versions are created.
- Build flexible workflows configurable without code changes.
- Implement optimistic locking for BOM and document edits.
- Encrypt document storage and use signed URLs for access control.

---

## üìã 9. Possible Interview/Discussion Questions

- How would you manage document version conflicts during concurrent edits?
- How can PLM workflows adapt to organization-specific compliance rules?
- How would you optimize retrieval for BOMs with deep component hierarchies?
- How would you support offline-first collaboration?
