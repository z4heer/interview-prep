## 🏗 2. High-Level Architecture (HLD)

**Main Components:**
- Supply Chain API Gateway
- Supplier Data Integration Service
- Carrier Tracking Integration Service
- Event Processing Engine
- ETA Prediction Service
- Centralized Database

## 🛤️ 6. Low-Level Design (LLD)

### 📦 Database Schema (Simplified)

**Tables**
- `shipments` — shipment_id (PK), origin, destination, supplier_id, carrier_id, status, eta, last_updated
- `suppliers` — supplier_id (PK), name, contact_info
- `carriers` — carrier_id (PK), name, tracking_api_url
- `alerts` — alert_id (PK), shipment_id (FK), alert_type, created_at

### 🔄 APIs (Supply Chain Microservice)

| API Endpoint                      | Method | Description                           |
|------------------------------------|--------|---------------------------------------|
| `/api/v1/shipments`               | GET    | Get all shipment details              |
| `/api/v1/shipment/{id}`           | GET    | Get specific shipment details         |
| `/api/v1/suppliers`               | GET    | Get supplier list                     |
| `/api/v1/carriers`                | GET    | Get carrier list                      |
| `/api/v1/alerts`                  | GET    | Fetch active alerts                   |

## 🔥 7. Scalability and Reliability Considerations

- **Batching + Streaming:** Efficient processing of incoming supplier/carrier data.
- **Caching:** Hot data (current shipments) caching via Redis.
- **ElasticSearch:** For fast shipment status searches.
- **Retry and Dead-Letter Queues:** Kafka for failed updates.
- **Geo-distributed Databases:** If serving multi-country supply chains.

---

## 🧩 8. Best Practices Summary

- Use circuit breaker when connecting to third-party APIs.
- Implement distributed tracing across services.
- Secure external API integrations with OAuth or API keys.
- Graceful degradation for delayed supplier/carrier feeds.
- Dashboard metrics: Supplier/Carrier performance KPIs.

---

## 📋 9. Possible Interview/Discussion Questions

- How would you handle delayed or missing tracking data?
- What machine learning model would you use for ETA prediction?
- How would you optimize API calls to third-party carriers?
- What design patterns would you use for real-time data aggregation?
