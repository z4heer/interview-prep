## 🧠 5. Microservices Breakdown

| Service                  | Responsibilities                              |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Inventory Service         | CRUD for stock data, stock allocation         |
| Ingestion Service         | Collect data from devices, batch/send to API  |
| Real-Time Engine          | Detect stock thresholds, trigger alerts      |
| Notification Service      | Send SMS, Email, App Notifications            |
| Auth Service              | OAuth2 based login/signup + roles             |

---

## 🛤️ 6. Low-Level Design (LLD)

### 📦 Database Schema (Simplified)

**Tables**
- `items` — item_id (PK), item_name, quantity, location
- `alerts` — alert_id (PK), item_id (FK), alert_type, created_at
- `users` — user_id (PK), username, password_hash, role

### 🔄 APIs (Inventory Microservice)

| API Endpoint                     | Method | Description                         |
|-----------------------------------|--------|-------------------------------------|
| `/api/v1/items`                  | GET    | Get all inventory items             |
| `/api/v1/item/{id}`              | GET    | Get item details                    |
| `/api/v1/item`                   | POST   | Add new item                        |
| `/api/v1/item/{id}`              | PUT    | Update item details                 |
| `/api/v1/item/{id}`              | DELETE | Delete an item                      |

## 🔥 7. Scalability and Reliability Considerations

- **IoT Buffering:** Batch data in devices during network issues.
- **API Gateway Rate Limits:** Protect backend from DDoS or faulty clients.
- **Database Sharding:** Future-proof for millions of items.
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern:** Between microservices (Resilience4j).
- **Auto-Scaling Kubernetes Pods** based on incoming IoT data volume.

---

## 🧩 8. Best Practices Summary

- Idempotent APIs (safe retries from devices)
- Immutable event logging (audit trails)
- Centralized error handling and retries
- Secure communication with HTTPS, JWT tokens
- Async event-driven processing wherever applicable

---

## 📋 9. Possible Interview/Discussion Questions

- How will you ensure real-time sync if warehouse devices lose connectivity?
- How to horizontally scale the ingestion service?
- What caching strategies would you use?
- How do you handle data inconsistency during high volume?
