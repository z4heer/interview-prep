## üõ§Ô∏è 6. Low-Level Design (LLD)

### üì¶ Database Schema (Simplified)

**Tables/Collections**
- `services` ‚Äî service_id (PK), title, category, price, provider_id, availability
- `users` ‚Äî user_id (PK), name, type (customer/provider), contact_info
- `bookings` ‚Äî booking_id (PK), service_id (FK), user_id (FK), status, booking_time
- `payments` ‚Äî payment_id (PK), booking_id (FK), amount, status
- `feedbacks` ‚Äî feedback_id (PK), booking_id (FK), rating, comment

### üîÑ APIs (Examples)

| API Endpoint                              | Method | Description                     |
|--------------------------------------------|--------|---------------------------------|
| `/api/v1/services/search`                  | GET    | Search for services             |
| `/api/v1/bookings`                         | POST   | Create a new booking            |
| `/api/v1/payments/charge`                  | POST   | Charge a payment                |
| `/api/v1/providers/onboard`                | POST   | Onboard a new service provider  |
| `/api/v1/feedback`                         | POST   | Submit feedback                 |

## üî• 7. Scalability and Reliability Considerations

- **Elastic scaling**: Scale booking and payment services independently based on load.
- **Dynamic pricing**: Use ML models for dynamic adjustment based on seasonality, demand.
- **Calendar conflict resolution**: Optimistic locking to avoid double bookings.
- **Cache popular services**: Redis cache for quick service lookup and search.
- **Fallback patterns**: Retry mechanisms for payment and notification failures.

---

## üß© 8. Best Practices Summary

- Secure payment handling using PCI DSS-compliant solutions.
- Use JWT tokens for stateless authentication.
- Encrypt sensitive user and provider information.
- Implement retries and dead-letter queues for event-driven processing.

---

## üìã 9. Possible Interview/Discussion Questions

- How would you ensure data consistency between bookings and payments?
- How would you design pricing adjustments dynamically based on real-time factors?
- How do you handle partial payment failures or refunds gracefully?
- How would you scale the system to 1M+ users across multiple cities?
