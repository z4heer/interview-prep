Would you also like me to immediately create **one full HLD+LLD template** (for example for "Smart Warehouse Management System") as the next `.md` file? 📚🚀  

If yes, just say **"continue with Smart Warehouse HLD"** —  
I'll give you a **full architecture diagram, tech choices, and service breakdown**! 🚀✨  
Shall we? 🎯
