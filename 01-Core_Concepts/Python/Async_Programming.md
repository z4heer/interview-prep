# üîÑ Async Programming in Python

Asynchronous programming is a way to perform tasks concurrently, which helps in improving the performance of I/O-bound operations like network requests, database queries, or file I/O. In Python, `asyncio` provides an efficient framework to work with asynchronous programming using `async` and `await` keywords.

## üß† Key Concepts in Async Programming

### 1. **Concurrency vs Parallelism**
   - **Concurrency**: Allows multiple tasks to be executed in an overlapping manner, but not necessarily simultaneously. Concurrency can improve efficiency, especially in I/O-bound tasks.
   - **Parallelism**: Involves executing multiple tasks at the exact same time. Typically used in CPU-bound tasks.

### 2. **Event Loop**
   - The core of Python's `asyncio` is the **event loop**, which schedules and runs asynchronous tasks. The event loop runs as long as there are tasks to execute.

### 3. **Coroutines**
   - A **coroutine** is a special function that can pause execution and yield control back to the event loop, allowing other tasks to run in the meantime.
   - Coroutines are defined using the `async def` syntax.
   - Example:
     ```python
     async def fetch_data():
         print("Fetching data...")
         await asyncio.sleep(2)
         print("Data fetched")
     ```

### 4. **`async` and `await` Keywords**
   - **`async`**: Used to define a function as a coroutine.
   - **`await`**: Used to pause the execution of the coroutine until the awaited task completes.
   - Example:
     ```python
     async def main():
         await fetch_data()
     asyncio.run(main())
     ```

### 5. **Tasks and Futures**
   - **Task**: An abstraction over a coroutine, scheduled to run concurrently. It is used to execute coroutines in the event loop.
   - **Future**: Represents a result that may not be available yet. Used to handle the result of a coroutine in an asynchronous manner.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Writing Async Code

### 1. **Defining a Coroutine**
   A coroutine is a function that performs asynchronous tasks. It is defined with the `async def` syntax.
   ```python
   async def say_hello():
       print("Hello")
       await asyncio.sleep(1)
       print("World")
   ```

### 2. **Using `await` to Call Coroutines**
   `await` pauses the current coroutine until the awaited function finishes execution.
   ```python
   async def fetch_data():
       print("Starting data fetch...")
       await asyncio.sleep(2)
       print("Data fetched!")
   ```

### 3. **Running Async Code with Event Loop**
   Use `asyncio.run()` to run the main coroutine in the event loop.
   ```python
   async def main():
       await fetch_data()

   asyncio.run(main())
   ```

### 4. **Gathering Multiple Tasks**
   You can run multiple coroutines concurrently using `asyncio.gather()`. This method runs tasks in parallel and waits for all of them to complete.
   ```python
   async def task1():
       print("Task 1 started")
       await asyncio.sleep(2)
       print("Task 1 finished")

   async def task2():
       print("Task 2 started")
       await asyncio.sleep(1)
       print("Task 2 finished")

   async def main():
       await asyncio.gather(task1(), task2())

   asyncio.run(main())
   ```

### 5. **Handling Exceptions in Async Code**
   Exceptions in coroutines can be handled using try-except blocks, just like in synchronous code.
   ```python
   async def fetch_data():
       try:
           await asyncio.sleep(2)
           raise ValueError("An error occurred!")
       except ValueError as e:
           print(f"Caught an error: {e}")

   asyncio.run(fetch_data())
   ```

## üîç Advanced Concepts in Async Programming

### 1. **Async Generators**
   - Async generators are used to generate values asynchronously. They are defined using `async def` and `yield` keywords.
   - Example:
     ```python
     async def async_gen():
         for i in range(3):
             await asyncio.sleep(1)
             yield i
     ```

### 2. **Async Context Managers**
   - An **async context manager** is a way to handle resources (such as file I/O or network connections) asynchronously. You use the `async with` statement to create an async context manager.
   - Example:
     ```python
     class AsyncFileReader:
         def __init__(self, filename):
             self.filename = filename

         async def __aenter__(self):
             self.file = await asyncio.to_thread(open, self.filename, 'r')
             return self.file

         async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc, tb):
             if self.file:
                 self.file.close()

     async def read_file():
         async with AsyncFileReader('data.txt') as file:
             data = await file.read()
             print(data)

     asyncio.run(read_file())
     ```

### 3. **Asyncio Queues**
   - `asyncio.Queue` provides a way to manage tasks or items asynchronously.
   - Example:
     ```python
     import asyncio

     async def producer(queue):
         for i in range(5):
             await asyncio.sleep(1)
             await queue.put(i)
             print(f"Produced: {i}")

     async def consumer(queue):
         while True:
             item = await queue.get()
             print(f"Consumed: {item}")
             queue.task_done()

     async def main():
         queue = asyncio.Queue()
         producer_task = asyncio.create_task(producer(queue))
         consumer_task = asyncio.create_task(consumer(queue))

         await asyncio.gather(producer_task, consumer_task)

     asyncio.run(main())
     ```

## üöÄ Performance and Best Practices

1. **Use `async` for I/O-bound tasks**: Async programming is best suited for I/O-bound tasks, such as reading files, making network requests, or interacting with databases.
2. **Avoid using `asyncio` for CPU-bound tasks**: CPU-bound tasks should be handled by separate threads or processes, as `asyncio` does not provide parallelism.
3. **Limit concurrency**: Use semaphores or limit the number of concurrent tasks if you are dealing with external resources like APIs or databases.
4. **Handle exceptions properly**: Make sure to handle exceptions in asynchronous code to prevent tasks from failing silently.
5. **Use `asyncio.run()` only once**: It should be used to run the top-level entry point for your asynchronous program.
