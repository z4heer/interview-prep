## 📚 Key Technical Words & Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Decorator** | A design pattern that allows behavior to be added to a function or class dynamically. |
| **Generator** | A function that returns an iterator and produces values lazily using `yield`. |
| **Multithreading** | Running multiple threads in a single process (Python threads are limited by GIL). |
| **Multiprocessing** | Running multiple processes, each with its own Python interpreter and memory space. |
| **GIL (Global Interpreter Lock)** | A mutex that protects access to Python objects, limiting true multithreading. |
| **Context Manager** | Manages resources like file streams (`with open('file.txt') as f:`). |
| **Async IO** | Asynchronous programming technique to handle many tasks seemingly at once using `await`. |

## 🔎 Common Interview Questions

- How do Python decorators work internally?
- What is the difference between `yield` and `return`?
- When to use Multithreading vs Multiprocessing?
- What is GIL and how does it affect concurrency?
- How does Python handle memory management and garbage collection?
- Explain the event loop in Async IO.

## 🧪 Code Snippets

### ✅ Decorator Example
```python
def decorator_func(original_func):
    def wrapper_func(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f'Wrapper executed before {original_func.__name__}')
        return original_func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper_func

@decorator_func
def display():
    print('Display function executed')

display()
```

### ✅ Generator Example
```python
def generate_numbers():
    for i in range(5):
        yield i

for num in generate_numbers():
    print(num)
```

### ✅ Multithreading Example
```python
import threading

def print_numbers():
    for i in range(5):
        print(i)

thread = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)
thread.start()
```

### ✅ Multiprocessing Example
```python
import multiprocessing

def print_numbers():
    for i in range(5):
        print(i)

process = multiprocessing.Process(target=print_numbers)
process.start()
```

### ✅ Async/Await Example
```python
import asyncio

async def say_hello():
    print("Hello")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print("World")

asyncio.run(say_hello())
```

## 🎯 Best Practices Summary

- ✅ Use decorators for cross-cutting concerns like logging, timing, or authorization.
- ✅ Use generators to work with large datasets to save memory.
- ✅ Use multiprocessing to bypass GIL limitations for CPU-bound tasks.
- ✅ Prefer multithreading for IO-bound operations like API calls.
- ✅ Always close resources properly using context managers.
- ✅ Understand when to apply Async IO for scalable networking applications.

## 📘 Cheat Sheet Summary

| Concept | Usage |
|---------|-------|
| Decorators | Add functionality to functions/classes. |
| Generators | Lazy evaluation for memory efficiency. |
| Multithreading | IO-bound tasks with concurrent execution. |
| Multiprocessing | CPU-bound tasks using multiple processes. |
| Context Manager | Resource management (`with open()`). |
| Async IO | Scalable concurrent programming. |

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why Avoid |
|---------|-----------|
| Heavy computation in threads | Threads are limited by GIL; prefer multiprocessing. |
| Not closing opened files | May cause resource leaks. |
| Blocking calls in async code | Freezes the entire event loop. |
| Unhandled exceptions in threads/processes | Can crash or leak resources silently. |
