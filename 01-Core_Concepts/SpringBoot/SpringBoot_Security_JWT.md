# 📚 Spring Boot Security with JWT

Securing REST APIs is a **critical skill** for backend architecture — especially using **JWT (JSON Web Token)** for authentication and authorization.

## 📚 Key Technical Words & Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Spring Security** | Framework for securing Java applications and REST APIs. |
| **JWT (JSON Web Token)** | Compact, self-contained token used for securely transmitting information between parties. |
| **Authentication** | Verifying the identity of a user or system. |
| **Authorization** | Granting access to resources based on permissions or roles. |
| **UserDetailsService** | Interface to load user-specific data for authentication. |
| **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** | Restricting system access based on roles assigned to users. |

## 🧪 Code Snippets

### ✅ JWT Authentication Filter (Login)
```java
public class JwtAuthenticationFilter extends UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter {
    @Override
    public Authentication attemptAuthentication(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {
        // Parse login credentials and authenticate
    }

    @Override
    protected void successfulAuthentication(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response,
                                             FilterChain chain, Authentication authResult) {
        // Generate and send JWT token
    }
}
```

### ✅ JWT Authorization Filter (Protected APIs)
```java
public class JwtAuthorizationFilter extends BasicAuthenticationFilter {
    @Override
    protected void doFilterInternal(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, FilterChain chain) {
        // Validate JWT token and set security context
    }
}
```

### ✅ UserDetailsService Implementation
```java
@Service
public class CustomUserDetailsService implements UserDetailsService {
    @Override
    public UserDetails loadUserByUsername(String username) throws UsernameNotFoundException {
        // Load user from database and map to Spring Security User
    }
}
```

## 🎯 Best Practices Summary

- ✅ Always encrypt JWT signing keys and never expose them.
- ✅ Implement refresh tokens for better user experience and security.
- ✅ Use strong hashing algorithms like `BCryptPasswordEncoder` for passwords.
- ✅ Handle exceptions like expired/invalid tokens gracefully.
- ✅ Set token expiration time (e.g., 15 minutes for access token).

## 📘 Cheat Sheet Summary

| Topic | Summary |
|-------|---------|
| Authentication Filter | Validates login and issues token. |
| Authorization Filter | Validates requests with token. |
| UserDetailsService | Loads user-specific information from DB. |
| Password Encoder | `BCryptPasswordEncoder` is recommended. |
| Secure Endpoints | `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ROLE_USER')")` etc. |

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why Avoid |
|---------|-----------|
| Long-lived Tokens | Higher risk if token is stolen. |
| No Expiration Check | Invites replay attacks and misuse. |
| Not Validating Signature | Token can be forged easily. |
| Hardcoding Secrets | Should be managed securely using environment variables or vaults. |
