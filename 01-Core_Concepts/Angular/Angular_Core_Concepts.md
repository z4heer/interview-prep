## 📚 Key Technical Words & Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Module** | A logical unit of functionality that organizes related code in Angular. |
| **Component** | The basic UI building block in Angular, consisting of template, style, and class. |
| **@NgModule** | Decorator that defines an Angular module. |
| **Data Binding** | Mechanism for communication between component and template. |
| **Directives** | Special markers in templates that modify DOM behavior or appearance. |
| **Lifecycle Hooks** | Methods that allow you to tap into the life cycle of components (e.g., `ngOnInit`). |
| **Service** | Class that provides business logic or data management to the application. |
| **Dependency Injection (DI)** | Pattern where dependencies (services) are provided to a component or service. |
| **RouterModule** | Angular module that enables routing and navigation between views. |
| **Observables** | A powerful asynchronous data stream used throughout Angular for handling HTTP requests, events, etc. |

## 🔎 Common Interview Questions

- What is Angular's data binding mechanism, and what are the types?
- Explain the difference between `@NgModule` and `@Component`.
- How would you use routing in Angular for navigation between pages?
- What is the role of Observables in Angular, and how is RxJS utilized?
- How does Angular's Dependency Injection system work?
- What are Angular lifecycle hooks and when should they be used?

## 🧪 Code Snippets

### ✅ @NgModule Example
```typescript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [BrowserModule],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

### ✅ Component Example with Data Binding
```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: `<h1>{{title}}</h1>`
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'Hello Angular';
}
```

### ✅ Service Example with Dependency Injection
```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class DataService {
  getData() {
    return 'Some data from service';
  }
}
```

### ✅ Router Example with Navigation
```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { Router } from '@angular/router';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: `<button (click)="navigate()">Go to Profile</button>`
})
export class AppComponent {
  constructor(private router: Router) {}

  navigate() {
    this.router.navigate(['/profile']);
  }
}
```

## 🎯 Best Practices Summary

- ✅ Break your Angular app into **feature modules** to keep the codebase organized.
- ✅ Use **services** for logic that needs to be shared across components.
- ✅ Use **`@Injectable()`** for services to enable **dependency injection**.
- ✅ Use **lazy loading** for feature modules to enhance application performance.
- ✅ Use **Angular lifecycle hooks** to initialize or clean up resources in components.
- ✅ Use **rxjs operators** like `map`, `mergeMap`, and `switchMap` to transform or merge streams.

## 📘 Cheat Sheet Summary

| Concept | Summary |
|---------|---------|
| Modules | Organize code into logical units; import/export dependencies. |
| Components | UI building blocks with templates, styles, and business logic. |
| Services | Provide reusable business logic or data to components. |
| Dependency Injection | Inject services into components to avoid tight coupling. |
| Routing | Use `RouterModule` for navigation and lazy loading. |
| Observables | Handle asynchronous data streams with RxJS operators. |

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why Avoid |
|---------|-----------|
| Forgetting to import required modules | Causes errors or missing functionality in the app. |
| Not unsubscribing from Observables | Leads to memory leaks and performance issues. |
| Overusing services in components | Can result in tightly coupled components and hard-to-test code. |
| Missing route guards | Exposes sensitive pages to unauthorized users. |
| Using any for type safety | Can break type consistency and lead to runtime errors. |
