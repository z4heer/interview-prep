# Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) Mindmap

Core concepts, design patterns, and best practices for building Event-Driven systems.

---

## 🧠 Mind Map

- **Core Concepts**
  - Events
  - Producers
  - Consumers
  - Brokers (Kafka, RabbitMQ, etc.)

- **Communication Models**
  - Pub/Sub (Publish-Subscribe)
  - Event Streaming
  - Event Sourcing

- **Design Patterns**
  - CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
  - Saga Pattern
  - Event-Carried State Transfer

- **Best Practices**
  - Event Schema Design
  - Idempotency Handling
  - Ordering Guarantees
  - Dead Letter Queues (DLQ)

## 🎯 Key Technical Words & Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|:-----|:-----------|
| Event | A record of an action or change in system state. |
| Event Producer | A component that emits events when actions occur. |
| Event Consumer | A component that reacts to events. |
| Event Broker | Middleware that transports events between producers and consumers (e.g., Kafka). |
| CQRS | Separate models for reading and writing data to optimize scalability and performance. |
| Event Sourcing | Persisting the state of a system as a sequence of events. |

## 🛠️ Code Snippet Example - Kafka Event Producer (Java)

```java
@Service
public class OrderEventProducer {

    @Autowired
    private KafkaTemplate<String, OrderEvent> kafkaTemplate;

    public void sendOrderEvent(OrderEvent event) {
        kafkaTemplate.send("order-events", event.getOrderId(), event);
    }
}
```
*Produces an event to Kafka when an order action occurs.*

## ✅ Best Practices Summary

- Use well-defined, versioned schemas for events (e.g., Avro, Protobuf).
- Design idempotent consumers to handle duplicate events safely.
- Ensure critical events are acknowledged (ack) after successful processing.
- Use DLQs for unprocessable events to avoid system failures.
- Monitor lag in event queues and scale consumers dynamically.
- Always ensure backward and forward compatibility in event evolution.

---

## 🚫 Common Mistakes

- Not handling duplicate events → inconsistent state.
- Tight coupling between producer and consumer contracts.
- Overusing event sourcing when not needed → complex event replay logic.
- Lack of event validation → corrupt data flows.

## 📋 Cheat Sheet Summary

| Area | Key Tip |
|:-----|:--------|
| Event Design | Simple, immutable, versioned events |
| Broker Choice | Kafka for high-throughput, RabbitMQ for low-latency |
| Consumer Resiliency | Idempotent operations, retries, DLQ |
| Scaling | Partitioning and consumer groups |
| Monitoring | Lag metrics, delivery failures, throughput alerts |
