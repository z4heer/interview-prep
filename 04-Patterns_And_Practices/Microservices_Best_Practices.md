## 🎯 Key Technical Words & Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|:-----|:-----------|
| Bounded Context | Logical boundary that encapsulates a microservice's functionality and data. |
| API Gateway | Centralized entry point for all microservices communication. |
| Circuit Breaker | Prevents cascading failures by temporarily blocking calls to a failing service. |
| Saga Pattern | Manage distributed transactions across services. |
| Eventual Consistency | Allow data across services to become consistent over time. |
| Polyglot Persistence | Different databases for different microservices depending on need. |

## ❓ Common Interview Questions

- How do you design microservices to be independently deployable?
- What are the common challenges of managing microservices at scale?
- Explain the use of Circuit Breaker pattern.
- How does the Saga pattern work in distributed transactions?
- What strategies can you use for service discovery?

## 🛠️ Code Snippet Example - Circuit Breaker (Spring Cloud)

```java
@CircuitBreaker(name = "orderService", fallbackMethod = "orderFallback")
public Order getOrderDetails(String orderId) {
    return orderClient.getOrder(orderId);
}

public Order orderFallback(String orderId, Throwable t) {
    return new Order(orderId, "Fallback Order");
}
```
*Protects the system from cascading failures by handling fallback logic.*

## ✅ Best Practices Summary

- Align services with business domains (Bounded Context).
- Prefer asynchronous communication (event-driven) wherever feasible.
- Implement centralized logging, distributed tracing, and metrics.
- Use API Gateway for cross-cutting concerns (auth, rate limiting, routing).
- Apply proper versioning for APIs.
- Design for failure: retries, circuit breakers, timeouts.
- Secure APIs and communication channels using OAuth2, JWT, mTLS.

---

## 🚫 Common Mistakes

- Overloading the API Gateway with too much logic.
- Not establishing clear service boundaries → tight coupling.
- Over-synchronizing services instead of using async/event-based design.
- Ignoring observability (logging, metrics, tracing) from the start.
- Direct database access between services (violating autonomy).

## 📋 Cheat Sheet Summary

| Area | Key Tip |
|:-----|:--------|
| Service Design | Bounded contexts, high cohesion, low coupling |
| Communication | Prefer async, use retries and fallbacks |
| Data | Own database per service, eventual consistency |
| Observability | Centralized logging, distributed tracing |
| Security | OAuth2, API Gateway, mTLS between services |
