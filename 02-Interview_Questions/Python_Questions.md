## 🎯 Python Interview Questions

### Core Python

1. **Explain Python's memory management model.**
2. **What are *args and **kwargs in functions?**
3. **What are Python Decorators and how are they implemented?**
4. **Explain shallow copy vs deep copy with examples.**

### OOP in Python

5. **How is polymorphism implemented in Python?**
6. **Explain the concept of MRO (Method Resolution Order).**
7. **What are dataclasses and when would you use them?**

### Advanced Python

8. **How does a Python generator differ from a normal function?**
9. **What is a Context Manager? How do you create one manually?**
10. **Explain metaclasses in Python.**

### Concurrency and Parallelism

11. **Difference between threading, multiprocessing, and asyncio.**
12. **What is GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) in Python?**

### Web Development

13. **How does Flask differ from FastAPI?**
14. **How do you handle input validation in FastAPI?**
15. **What is WSGI and how does it work?**

### Data Handling and APIs

16. **How do you serialize and deserialize data in Python APIs?**
17. **What is ORM and how does SQLAlchemy work?**

## 📋 Quick Cheat Sheet

| Area | Key Focus |
| :--- | :--- |
| OOP | MRO, Dataclasses, Special Methods |
| Advanced | Decorators, Generators, Context Managers |
| Async | asyncio, Futures, Event Loop |
| Web | Flask Routing, FastAPI Performance |
| Testing | pytest Fixtures, Mocking |

---

## 🔥 Common Mistakes

- Confusing concurrency with parallelism.
- Forgetting about blocking calls inside `async` code.
- Poor error handling or missing validation in APIs.
